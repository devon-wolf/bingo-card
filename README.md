# bingo-card
A general-purpose bingo card

The current main branch is just a blank bingo card - it does not accept user input or do anything other than be a square full of squares. The development branch will contain features under construction as they emerge, such as accepting user input to fill the blank boxes, changing the appearance as boxes are marked/checked-off, and indicating whether the user has achieved the enviable state of BINGO.
